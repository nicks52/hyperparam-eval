# Evaluation of Hyperparameters in DNN and CNNs
### By Nick Serger

Evaluating hyperparameters by building several DNN and CNN models to classify the CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets using keras and tensorflow.

This evaluation was started as the final project for George Mason University's ECE 527: Learning From Data (Machine Learning) Final Project and was further expanded to evaluate the hyperparameters in greater detail.
