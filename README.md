# Evaluation of Hyperparameters and Model Structure in CNNs
### By Nick Serger

Evaluating hyperparameters and model structure by building several CNN models to classify the CIFAR10 datasets using keras and tensorflow.

This evaluation was started as the final project for George Mason University's ECE 527: Learning From Data (Machine Learning) Final Project and was further expanded to evaluate the hyperparameters in greater detail.
